# 🛡️ Fraud Detection System (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning–based fraud detection system** using transactional banking data.  
The goal is to identify potentially fraudulent transactions by learning patterns from historical data and applying supervised classification models.

The project is designed as a **portfolio-ready data science and machine learning project**, demonstrating the full analytical pipeline from raw data to model interpretation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Financial fraud is a major challenge for banks and digital payment platforms.  
Fraudulent transactions are **rare but high-impact**, making them difficult to detect using traditional rule-based systems.

This project aims to:
- Detect fraudulent transactions accurately
- Handle **class imbalance**
- Minimise **false negatives** (missed fraud cases)
- Provide **model explainability** for real-world decision making

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Datetime feature engineering
- Categorical encoding
- Class imbalance handling (SMOTE)
- Supervised machine learning models
- Model evaluation and validation
- Feature importance analysis
- Model explainability using SHAP

---

## 🔍 Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Random Forest with SMOTE (balanced training data)

Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

---

## 📊 Interpretability & Explainability
Because fraud detection is a high-stakes domain, this project includes:
- Feature importance analysis
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model predictions

This mirrors real-world requirements in financial institutions where transparency is critical.
